    to date of WZ, W$^{\pm}$W$^{\pm}$, and W$\gamma$ vector boson scattering. Currently reviewing and guiding
    more than ten on-going analyses.

\section{\textsc{CMS Analysis Activities}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{{Precision measurements of W and Z boson production}} \\

    W and Z events with the state-of-the-art MiNNLO program at NNLO in QCD,
    significantly reducing Monte Carlo statistical and modeling uncertainties
    for the W mass, weak mixing angle, and other precision measurements.
    Developed technical implementation and analysis strategy to match MiNNLO predictions to
    highest-accuracy resummation results at N$^{3}$LL, 
    reducing the modeling uncertainty by a further 10-20\% in the region most relevant for the W mass measurement.

    Closely involved in the development of the extended study (CMS publication 3), including 
    development of a novel approach
    to simultaneously measure the WZ and W$^{\pm}$W$^{\pm}$ electroweak cross sections.
    Projections of CMS electroweak WZ production measurement to high luminosity, including studies of
    WZ polarization and sensitivity to new physics (CMS publication 5, other publication 3).
