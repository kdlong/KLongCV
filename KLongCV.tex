\section{Experience}
\cventry{Aug 2019 - present}{Senior research fellow}{European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)}{Geneva, CH}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and deployed graph neural network for fast and accurate clustering of hundreds of thousands of electrical signals into clusters of a common origin. 
    \item Developed visualization framework exploiting modern python packages (numpy, pandas, plotly) for evaluation of clustering algorithms.
    \item Developed production framework for a lightweight and versatile columnar data format used by hundreds of scientists for faster simulation production and more intuitive analysis. Recognized with a collaboration-wide award for this work.
    \item Using state-of-the art tools implementing TensorFlow to perform complex maximum-likelihood fits with hundreds of bins and thousands of nuisance parameters to precisely estimate data set properties.
    \item Coordinated group of $\sim$50 colleagues making measurements of predicted, but previously unmeasured, phenomena. Lead review of 15-20 projects, resulting in $\sim$10 publications per year.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul 2013 - Jul 2019}{Researcher}{University of Wisconsin-Madison}{Madison, WI, USA and Geneva, CH}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzed data set of billions of particle collisions to perform the first measurement of a rare process. Used statistical modeling and maximum likelihood estimation to establish the properties of this new process and their statistical significance.
    \item Developed, validated, and deployed scalable software frameworks to perform big data analysis using
distributed computing infrastructure (100 GB--1 PB pipelines) that led to several publication. Framework currently used by 10-20 people.
    \item Lead a small group ($\sim$10 people) on the support, software integration, and validation of new simulation tools, exploiting expertise in software, numerical calculations, and distributed computing.
    \item Instructor for two classes of electricity and magnetism for engineers ($\sim$50 students). Prepared 4 lectures/week and 2 labs/week, wrote and graded assignments.
\end{itemize}
