Focusing on precision standard model measurements and new physics searches in 
diboson channels. Made significant contributions to first 13 TeV measurements of 
WZ and ZZ cross sections at CMS and currently leading analysis efforts 
towards the observation of WZ vector boson scattering. 
Played a leading role in CMS for production and validation of
Monte Carlo simulation for standard model processes.
Also involved in data quality monitoring for the Cathode Strip 
Chambers (CSC) of the CMS muon detector system, CSC detector-on-call shifts, and longevity studies for the CSC at the CERN 
Gamma Irradiation Facility.

Assisted in construction and design of the SAMURAI Time Projection Chamber. 
Particularly involved in selecting conductive materials for use in active 
volume of detector. Researched and tested products for performance and lack 
of contaminants. Also focused on optimizing performance of the TPC gating grid circuit.
