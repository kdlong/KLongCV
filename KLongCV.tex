\section{Experience}
\cventry{Aug 2019 - present}{Physicist and data scientist}{Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)}{Geneva, CH}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leader of a 20 person development team maintaining and developing clustering algorithms to convert detector signals to high-level representations of particle collisions.
    \item Developed and deployed custom graph neural network with for fast clustering of $\mathcal{O}$(100k) electrical signals by common origin,
        improving accuracy by $\sim$25\% over algorithmic approach (publication 1). Built plotly-based dashboard to visualize and assess performance.
    \item Principle developer, maintainer, and reviewer of software framework with $\sim$20 contributors. Implemented self-hosted GitHub CI for automated validation of full processing pipeline.
    \item Designed and developed production framework for lightweight columnar data storage format used by hundreds of scientists, reducing storage footprint and processing time by an order of magnitude with respect to previous format. Recognized with a collaboration-wide award for this work.
    \item Coordinated group of $\sim$50 colleagues making measurements of predicted, but previously unmeasured, phenomena. Lead review of 15-20 projects, resulting in $\sim$20 publications over two years.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul 2013 - Jul 2019}{Doctoral researcher}{University of Wisconsin-Madison}{Madison, WI, USA and Geneva, CH}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed, validated, and deployed scalable software frameworks to perform big data analysis using
distributed computing infrastructure (100 GB--1 PB pipelines), used by 10-20 people.
    \item Lead a group ($\sim$10 people) on the support, software integration, and validation of new simulation tools, exploiting expertise in software, numerical calculations, and distributed computing.
    \item Instructor for two classes of electricity and magnetism for engineers ($\sim$50 students). Prepared 4 lectures/week and 2 labs/week, wrote and graded assignments.
\end{itemize}
